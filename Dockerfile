# PYTHON image
# Use the official Docker Python image because it has the absolute latest bugfix version of Python
# it has the absolute latest system packages
# it’s based on Debian Bookworm (Debian 12), released June 2023
# Initial Image size is 51MB
# At the end Image size is 156MB

# I did not recommed using an alpine image because it lacks the package installer pip and the support for installing
# wheel packages, which are both needed for installing applications like Pandas and Numpy.
